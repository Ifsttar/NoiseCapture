# NoiseCapture
NoiseCapture is Android App dedicated to the measurement of environmental noise.
The development of NoiseCapture is in progress and is not working yet.

## Description
NoiseCapture is an Android App project for measuring environmental noise using a smartphone. The goal is to produce relevant noise indicators from audio recordings, including a geospatial representation.

## Features

NoiseCapture features are divided into 3 parts:

 - Measurement - Once the sound level calibration is done, the user start the measurement in order to record each second the LAeq, an average sound energy over a period of 1s. The spectrum repartition of the sound are analysed and stored using the Fourrier transform. The device location are recorded while measuring the sound level. The user has the hability to provide his own feedback about the feeling of the noise environment.

 - Extented report - Advanced statistics are computed locally on the phone and shown to the user. For each user's measurement the locations of the noise levels are displayed in a map.

 - Share results with the community - Anonymous results are transfered to Virtual Hubs (web server) and post-processed in order to build a noise map that merge all community results.
 
## Developments
NoiseCapture is a collaboration between the [Environmental Acoustic Laboratory](http://www.lae.ifsttar.fr/en/) ([Ifsttar](http://www.ifsttar.fr)) and the [Lab-STICC](http://www.lab-sticc.fr/) CNRS.

## Funding
This application was developed under the initial funding the European project [ENERGIC-OD](http://www.energic-od.eu/), with the help of the [GEOPAL](http://www.geopal.org/accueil) program.

## Licence
NoiseCapture is released under the GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3. Please refer to GPLv3 for more details.
